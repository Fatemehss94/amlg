    "# **A brief introduction to Markdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor.\n",
    "In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately.\n",
    "Markdown is not like that.\n",
    "When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., `# Heading One`).\n",
    "Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., `**this text is bold**`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an `.md` (or rarely a `.markdown`) extension.\n",
    "But how is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file.\n",
    "There are lots of applications available&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word.\n",
    "Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing: they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a \"parser\") to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format.\n",
    "At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "For a quick summary, you may want to look at a [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a heading, add hash symbols (`#`) in front of a word or phrase.\n",
    "The number of hash symbols you use corresponds to the heading level.\n",
    "For example, to create a level-three heading (`<h3>` in HTML), use three hash symbols (e.g., `### My Level-Three Heading`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as demonstrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add emphasis by making text **bold** or _italic_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bold\n",
    "\n",
    "To **bold** text, add two asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) before and after a word or phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Italic\n",
    "\n",
    "To _italicize_ text, add one asterisk (`*`) or underscore (`_`) before and after a word or phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blockquotes\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a blockquote.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can organize items into unordered and ordered lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unordered lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items.\n",
    "Indent one or more items to create a nested list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First item\n",
    "- Second item\n",
    "- Third item\n",
    "  - Indented item\n",
    "    - Double-indented item\n",
    "- Fourth item\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered lists\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First item\n",
    "2. Second item\n",
    "3. Third item\n",
    "4. Fourth item\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images\n",
    "\n",
    "To display an image, use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "![alt text](image.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more control over the image size, you can also use HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<img src=\"image.png\" alt=\"alt text\" width=\"600\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code and code blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "To display `code` inline, use single backticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic Markdown syntax allows you to create code blocks by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab.\n",
    "However, we recommend using so-called fenced code blocks.\n",
    "For that you'll use three backticks on the lines before and after the code block.\n",
    "The best part? You donâ€™t have to indent any lines!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"firstName\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "  \"lastName\": \"Idle\",\n",
    "  \"age\": 42\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Horizontal rules\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`), or underscores (`___`) on a line by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Links\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., `[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)`), which renders as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Markdown applications allow you to use HTML tags in Markdown-formatted text.\n",
    "This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax.\n",
    "For example, some people find it easier to use HTML tags for images.\n",
    "Using HTML is also helpful when you need to change the attributes of an element, like specifying the color of text or changing the width of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use HTML, place the tags in the text of your Markdown-formatted file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This renders as:\n",
    "\n",
    "This **word** is bold. This <em>word</em> is italic."
